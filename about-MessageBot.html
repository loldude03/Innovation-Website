    <h1>About neural conversational agents</h1>
    <p><b><font size="4.5">Neural conversational Agents are messaging bots that you can talk to and have a conversation with as much as you would like. Maybe you would want one if you are feeling lonely and just need someone to talk to but don’t know who to talk to or if you just don't have anyone to talk to. Or maybe you could use one of these bots to get feedback from, maybe you have a decision to make and you don't know what to do so you can ask the bot something simple like, "Should I make Spaghetti or Lasagna''. Then they would reply with something like, "Lasagna takes longer to make especially if you make it from scratch so I would recommend Spaghetti for a quicker delicious meal.” That of  course is just an example, you can do more than ask the bot what you should eat every night for dinner. There are a lot of things you could ask or say to the AI.</font></b></p>
