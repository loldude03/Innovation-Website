        <h2>Neural conversational models!</h2>
        <p>In case you don't know what neural conversational models are, they are messaging AI systems. They allow you to message and have a conversation with a robot that has a variety of things to reply with. Maybe you would want one if you are feeling lonely and just need someone to talk to but dont know who to talk to or if you just don't have anyone to talk to. Or maybe you could use one of these bots to get feedback from, maybe you have a decision to make and you don't know what to do so you can ask the bot something simple like, "Should I make Spaghetti or Lasagna". Then they would reply with something like, "Lasagna takes longer to make especially if you make it from scratch so I would recommend Spaghetti for a quicker delicious meal.</p>
